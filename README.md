# 📊 Dorwin Liang 

**`Data Analyst`**
Hi! I have over 1+ years of analytics-related experience across many industries including advertising, government, and education. As an Investment Associate, I'm executing and optimizing a multi-million dollar media investment budget for one of the biggest CPG brands.

Additionally, with a BBA in Computer Information Systems and Data Analytics, I have the perfect blend of technical skills, business acumen, and soft skills necessary to thrive in data analytics focused roles.

I'm also actively brushing up my skills and learning every day and you can check out my collection of data analytics-related work below!
